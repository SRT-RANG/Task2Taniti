    <p>Taniti is a picturesque tropical island in the Pacific, known for its diverse
      landscape despite its small size of under 500 square miles. Visitors can explore a mix
      of serene sandy beaches, rugged rocky shores, a sheltered harbor, vibrant rainforests,
      and a mountainous area with an active volcano. With a population of about 20,000,
      the island has shifted from its traditional fishingand agricultural roots to
      embrace a growing tourism industry.
